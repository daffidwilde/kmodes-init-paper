To give comparative results on the quality of the initialisation processes 
defined in Sections~\ref{sec:init}~\&~\ref{sec:proposed-method}, four 
well-known, categorical, labelled datasets - soybean, mushroom, breast cancer, 
and zoo - will be clustered with the \(k\)-modes algorithm. Then the typical 
performance measures of accuracy, precision, and recall will be calculated and 
summarised below. As a general rule, each algorithm will be trained on 
approximately two thirds of the respective dataset and tested against the final 
third.

Tables of results for each dataset and each initialisation process. Credit to

Huang and Cao processes, as well as the $k$-modes algorithm itself.
