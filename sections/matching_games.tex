\section{Matching games}\label{sec:matching}

The primary motivation for this work is to move away from the greedy approaches
defined above by incorporating some techniques from game theory, namely:
matching games. The purpose of solving a matching game is to link the elements
of two sets in a `fair' way so that no element could feasibly be better off. By
considering the virtual modes found during Huang's method with some suitable
subset of our dataset as a matching game to be solved, we hope to find a
closer-to-optimal set of initial modes for the \(k\)-modes algorithm.

\begin{definition}\label{def:matching_game}
    Consider two sets \(S, R\) each of size \(N\), and let us call them 
    `suitors' and `reviewers'. Each element of \(S\) and \(R\) has associated 
    with it a preference list of the other set's elements. These preference 
    lists are ranked in descending order. We consider the preference lists as 
    functions which produce tuples, \(f\) and \(g\) respectively:
	\[
	    f : S \to R^n, \ g : R \to S^n
	\]
	This construction of sets and preference lists is called a 
    \emph{matching game} of size \(N\) and we denote the game itself by 
    \((S,R)\).
	
    A matching, \(M\), is defined to be any bijection between \(S\) and \(R\). 
    If \(s \in S\) and \(r \in R\) are matched by \(M\), then we write
    \(M(s)~=~r\). A matching \(M\) is considered to be either stable or unstable
    based on the preference lists of its suitors and reviewers, and the presence
    of blocking pairs.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:blocking_pair}
    Let \((S, R)\) be a matching game of size \(N\) with some matching \(M\). A 
    pair \((s, r) \in S \times R\) is said to \emph{block} \(M\) if \(M(s) \neq
    r\) but \(s\) prefers \(r\) to \(M(s) = r'\) and \(r\) prefers \(s\) to
    \(M^{-1}(r) = s'\). That is, \(r\) appears before \(r'\) in \(f(s)\) and
    \(s\) appears before \(s'\) in \(g(r)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:stable_matching}
    Let \((S, R)\) be a matching game of size \(N\) with some matching \(M\). 
    Then we say \(M\) is a \emph{stable matching} if there are no blocking 
    pairs, and \emph{unstable} otherwise.
\end{definition}

\subsection{The Gale-Shapley algorithm}\label{subsec:galeshapley}

The Gale-Shapley algorithm is known to find a unique stable matching for any 
matching game of size \(N\). This matching is also considered to be 
suitor-optimal. That is, each suitor is matched with the best possible reviewer
that ensures a stable matching, but is in fact the worst possible matching for 
the reviewers. \textcolor{red}{[cite or have these theorems stated/proven]} 

As was discussed at the start of Section~\ref{sec:matching}, the outline of
the method proposed in this paper is to extend Huang's method by considering the
virtual modes with some subset of the data as a matching game to be solved. It
should be noted, however, that in this method we may not have equally sized 
sets of suitors and reviewers. As a result of this, the Gale-Shapley algorithm 
becomes inapplicable as the matching produced \(M\) would not be a bijection of 
our suitors and reviewers.

\subsection{The capacitated Gale-Shapley algorithm for the hospital-resident 
	problem}\label{subsec:capacitated_galeshapley}

The situation where a large set of suitors are to be matched with a number
reviewers is not limited to abstraction. A practical example of this problem is
how to best assign a cohort of medical students to a group of hospitals. Here, 
we have all of the requisite components of a matching game:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A set of reviewers (the hospitals) and a set of suitors (the potential
        residents) 
	\item A ranking of the students/residents by the hospitals, and vice versa
\end{itemize}

The only obstacle which stops us from using the Gale-Shapley algorithm is the 
disparity in the sizes of our sets. In reality, hospitals need not always take 
at most one resident on from a cohort of medical students. So each hospital has
a capacity associated with it and we can consider our matching game to be
`capacitated'. By this we mean that each reviewer (hospital) may be matched with
any number of suitors (students) up to their capacity, making our matching
\(M:~S~\to~R\) surjective.

Research surrounding the hospital-resident assignment problem is well-documented 
\textcolor{red}{[cite]} and an extension of the Gale-Shapley algorithm was
developed to solve it, awarding the authors the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economic
Sciences. This algorithm is currently used by the National Resident Matching
Program (\url{http://www.nrmp.org}) to assign medical students to hospitals in
the United States of America.

As before, we consider a set of suitors and reviewers denoted by \(S\) and 
\(R\). These sets are no longer (necessarily) the same size. We also have our 
preference lists \(f, g\), and a set \(C = \{c_1, \ldots, c_{|R|}\}\) of 
reviewer capacities. Finally, let \(S_u \subset S\) denote the set of suitors 
that are currently unmatched. The capacitated Gale-Shapley algorithm is given 
below.
