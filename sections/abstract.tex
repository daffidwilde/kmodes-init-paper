    This paper presents a new way of selecting an initial solution for the
    \(k\)-modes algorithm that allows for a notion of mathematical fairness and
    a leverage of the data that the common initialisations from literature do
    not. The method, which utilises the Hospital-Resident Assignment Problem to
    find the set of initial cluster centroids, is compared with the current
    initialisations on both benchmark datasets and a body of newly generated
    artificial datasets. Based on this analysis, the proposed method is shown to
    outperform the other initialisations in the majority of cases, especially
    when the number of clusters is optimised. In addition, we find that our
    method outperforms the leading established method specifically for
    low-density data.
