    The \(k\)-modes algorithm is a part of the family of clustering algorithms
    known as `prototype-based clustering', and is an extension of the
    \(k\)-means algorithm for categorical data as set out in~\cite{Huang1998}.
    This work will outline the key differences and similarities between two
    established initialisation methods for the \(k\)-modes algorithm, and in
    doing so we will be able to examine how the initial cluster selection
    process has an impact on the efficiency and quality of the \(k\)-modes
    algorithm. From there, we will define a new initialisation method that makes
    use of elements of game theory.
