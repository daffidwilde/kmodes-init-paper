    This paper presents a new way of selecting an initial solution for the
    \(k\)-modes algorithm that allows for some notion of mathematical fairness
    and a leverage of the data that the established initialisations do not. The
    method, which utilises the Hospital-Resident Assignment Problem to find the
    set of initial cluster centroids, is thoroughly compared with the current
    initialisations on both benchmark datasets and a body of newly generated
    artificial datasets.  Based on this analysis, the proposed method is shown
    to outperform the other initialisations in the majority of cases, especially
    when the number of clusters is optimised.
