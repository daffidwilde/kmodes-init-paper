    The \(k\)-modes algorithm is a centroid-based clustering algorithm, and is
    an extension of the \(k\)-means algorithm for categorical data. This work
    outlines a comparison of the established initialisation methods
    for the \(k\)-modes algorithm by use of examples and algebraic analysis of
    their cost functions. In doing so, the effect of the initial centroid
    selection on the overall efficiency and quality of the final clustering
    found by each method is exposed.

    Following this, a novel initialisation process is described that utilises
    game-theoretic results to create a fair and robust initial selection for the
    algorithm. This process is modelled on the hospital-resident assignment
    problem and is solved using an adapted Gale-Shapley algorithm.

    The paper concludes with a comparison between the established initialisation
    methods and the proposed method on a number of benchmark datasets, as well
    as an analysis using preferable artificial datasets. The analysis uses
    several label-invariant metrics to assess the quality of the clustering both
    at the beginning of the algorithm and at the end.
