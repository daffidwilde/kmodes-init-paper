\section{The proposed method}\label{sec:proposed-method}

Now that we have defined what we mean by a matching game, with the algorithm 
described above, we can construct an alternative initialisation process for the 
\(k\)-modes algorithm.

Let \textbf{X} be a dataset with attribute set \textbf{A}, and let
\(\tilde{\mu}\) be the set of virtual modes found by Huang's method (i.e.\ the
set of virtual centroids to be assigned to points in \textbf{X}). We then take
this set of virtual modes \(\tilde{\mu}\) and construct a capacitated matching
game to be solved by the capacitated Gale-Shapley algorithm in the following
way.

\begin{remark}
    The method for constructing the preference lists of our suitors can affect
    the outcome and performance of this method. Please refer to
    Sections~\ref{sec:preferences}~\&~\ref{sec:results}.
